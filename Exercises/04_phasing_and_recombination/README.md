# Inferring the genotype phase (AKA Phasing)

During base calling, we identified the two bases at each position in each diploid individual. However, we do not know which base goes on which of the two chromosomes. That means that we do not know if the two haploid chromosomes look like the left or right example below:

    -----A-----C------         -----T-----C------ 
    -----T-----G------    or   -----A-----G------


To do that we use the program Beagle, which uses a clusering algorithm to call the genotype phase.

We put the jointly called bases for Africans, West Eurasians, and East Asians in these three files:

- Africa (10 individuals): `Allvariants_africa.vcf`
- West Eurasia (10 individuals): `Allvariants_westeurasia.vcf`
- Eash Asia (8 individuals): `Allvariants_eastasia.vcf`

In this exercise we will just use the Africans and the West Eurasians.

## Running Beagle

For additional information see the [Beagle 4.1 manual](https://faculty.washington.edu/browning/beagle/beagle_4.1_03Oct15.pdf)

Africa:

    java -jar /home/shared/beagle.08Jun17.d8b.jar gt=/home/shared/data/Allvariants_africa.vcf map=/home/shared/data/plink.chr2.GRCh37.map out=Allvariants_africa_phased

West Eurasia

    java -jar /home/shared/beagle.08Jun17.d8b.jar gt=/home/shared/data/Allvariants_westeurasia.vcf map=/home/shared/data/plink.chr2.GRCh37.map out=Allvariants_westeurasia_phased

## Browsing the phased results

Download the phased VCF files to your computer and open them in IGV (integrative genomics viewer): 
    
1. Choose Human hg19 as the reference genome.
2. Click `File > Load from File...` and select you phased VCF file.

Explore phases of haplotypes at two positions in the alignment:

Select chr2, zoom all the way in and select find the base at position 136608646. Select that base in a European individual (ERR1025620 is English). Sort alignments by genotype (right-click on the base in the alignment tracks to get a popup menu). Consider these questions:

1. What does the haplotypes look like?
2. Do you see any long streches of homozygosity?
3. Which haplotypes agree?
4. How wide is the region where they agree?

The SNP at position 136608646. Try to search for 136608646 in the [UCSC genome browser](https://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?redirect=manual&source=genome.ucsc.edu). Remember we are using the Hg19 assembly version of the reference human genome. Can you find anything that explains your observations?

# Estimating a recombination map

[LDhat  manual](https://github.com/auton1/LDhat/blob/master/manual.pdf)

## Format input data for LDhat

LDhat needs its input data in a particular format. We will use vcftools to produce these input files from the phased VCF file:

Africa:

    vcftools --gzvcf Allvariants_africa_phased.vcf.gz --chr 2 --ldhat --out recmap_data_africa

West Eurasia:

    vcftools --gzvcf Allvariants_westeurasia_phased.vcf.gz --chr 2 --ldhat --out recmap_data_westeurasia

Have a look at the two files produced using `less`. E.g.:

    less recmap_data_africa.ldhat.sites 

> NB: press `q` to quit `less`

How do you think the information is encoded in these files?

## Running LDhat

To speed up computations you can make a lookup table first. That takes a while, so we did if for you. But it is done using the `complete` program that comes with LDhat:

    /usr/local/bin/complete -n 20 -rhomax 100 -n_pts 101 -theta 0.0001

- `-n 20`:the number of haplotypes (2 * 10).
- `-rhomax 100`: maximum rho ($4N_e r$) alowed: 100 (recommended).
- `-n_pts 101`: number of points in grid: 101 (recommended).
- `-theta 0.0001`: human theta ($4N_e \mu$).

That produces a file named `new_lk.txt` that we renamed to `lk_n20_theta1e-3.txt`. This file will serve as a look up table for the algorithm. It includes coalescent likelihoods for each pairs of SNPs using a grid of recombination rates.

The next step is to calculate the recombination map. Again, it may take a while. We suggest you team up in pairs and does the Africans while other does the West Eurasians. It will take around 8 minutes for the entire dataset.

Africa:

    rhomap -seq recmap_data_africa.ldhat.sites -loc recmap_data_africa.ldhat.locs -lk /home/shared/data/lk_n20_theta1e-3.txt -its 1000000 -samp 2000 -burn 0

*or* West Eurasia:

    rhomap -seq recmap_data_westeurasia.ldhat.sites -loc recmap_data_westeurasia.ldhat.locs -lk /home/shared/data/lk_n20_theta1e-3.txt -its 1000000 -samp 2000 -burn 0

- `-lk`: likelihood lookup table.
- `-its`: number of iterations of the MCMC.
- `-samp`: how often to sample from the MCMC.
- `-burn`: how many of the initial iterations to discard. Burnin is at least 100,000 divided by the value of `-samp`. Here we set it to zero to leave keep all samples. Then we look later how much burnin to discard.

When rhomap completes it writes three files:

- `acceptance_rates.txt`: acceptance rates of the MCMC. If they are lower than 1%. The program should be run with more iterations.
- `summary.txt`: (quoting the manual) for each SNP interval, the estimated genetic map position, the estimated recombination rate, and the hotspot density (the number of hotspots per kb per iteration).
- `rates.txt`: (quoting the manual) is the output from each sample detailing the recombination rate (expressed in $4N_e r$ per kb) between each SNP. 

Rename the `rates.txt` to `rates_africa.txt` or `rates_westeurasia.txt` depending on which analysis you do. E.g.:

```bash
mv acceptance_rates.txt acceptance_rates_africa.txt
mv summary.txt summary_africa.txt
mv rates.txt rates_africa.txt
```      
## Analyze results

Open Rstudio from the directory where your output files are. Do that by navigating into the right directory and then type `rstudio` in the terminal.

> NB: To make the rstudio window pop up on your screen you need to use the `-Y` option when you log in to the server: `ssh -Y etc...`

Now paste this into Rstudio console:

```R
source("http://ldhat.sourceforge.net/R/coalescent.r")
```

That loads a lot of R functions written by the author of LDhat.

Now run this code (if you analyze west eurasians you need to change the arguments accordingly):

```R
summary<-summarise.rhomap(rates.file = "rates_africa.txt", locs.file="recmap_data_africa.ldhat.locs")
```

The summary produces two plots:

- A graph of the recombination rate across on each polymorphic loci, along with confidence intervals.
- A plot showing how estimation of recombination rate has progressed with each MCMC sample (taken every 2000 updates). Notice that the initial run of MCMC samples are atypical. This is the "burn-in" of the MCMC. We want to remove that, so take notice of how many samples it corresponds to. If it is 50 they we can produce a new set of estimates that excludes this burn-in using the `stat` program that comes with LDhat:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/stat -input rates_africa.txt -loc recmap_data_africa.ldhat.locs -burn 50
```

This produces a file called `res.txt` that describes the confidence in the estimated recombination rate along the sequence. Rename the `res.txt` to `res_africa.txt` or `res_westeurasia.txt` depending on which analysis you do. E.g.:

```bash
mv res.txt res_africa.txt
```

Now try to plot the final results (if you analyze West Eurasians you must read `res_westeurasia.txt`). In order to have the positions of the loci for which we have estimated mean recombination rates, we will merge the new dataset created with the summary files generated by LDhat:

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(magrittr)

summary <- read.table('summary_africa.txt', header = T)
rates <- read.table("res_africa.txt", header=T)
rates %>%
  filter(Loci > 0) %>%
  mutate(pos=summary$Position.kb.*1000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=pos, y=Mean_rho, ymin=L95, ymax=U95)) +  
  geom_line(color='blue') +
  geom_ribbon(alpha=0.1) +
  theme_bw()
```

Look at the plots and ponder the following questions:

- Are there any recombination hotspots?
- Are there any regions where the estimated recombination rate is really low? 
- Can you see any hotspots in Africans that are not found in West Eurasians - other the othe way around?
- What does the recombination rate look like around the lactase gene?
