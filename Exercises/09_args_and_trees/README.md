# Relate

![billede](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47324240/158781125-b0d4af85-69dd-4d4a-b722-30da62e8c18f.png)

Male X chromosomes are easy to use for haplotype-based analysis, as they are haploid and therefore does not require phasing. However, autosomes are diploid, and we would like to use haplotype-based analysis here as well. This can be done through phasing.

Multiple phasing methods are known, such as Beagle (used in Week 4) and Shapeit. If you are lucky, the dataset you are using has already been phased, which is where we start this week. We are back to looking at chr2.

In this exercise we will run Relate to infer local trees along a genomic region, and subsequently use those trees for inference.

## Request an interactive session on a compute node:


To start off, request an interactive job.

```
srun --mem-per-cpu=5g --time=3:00:00 --account=populationgenomics --pty bash
```

## Set up an environment for the exercise:

Relate will produce plots with its population size and marginal tree scripts, and this requires some specific r packages. To keep the popgen environment light and snappy, let us install this in a separate environment.

<!-- TODO: Add the below packages to the popgen-notebooks env -->

```
conda create --name relate_r -c conda-forge r-base r-tidyverse r-ggplot2 r-cowplot r-gridextra
```

All the Relate scripts can be run in this environment, so make sure the `relate_r` is activated when you are working on this exericse. To help Relate find some files it needs you also need to run these four commands in order:

```
conda activate relate_r
conda env config vars set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CONDA_PREFIX/envs/popgen/lib
conda deactivate
conda activate relate_r
```

## Data

The chr2 data for this exerise is taken from 60 individuals in the 1000Genomes project. In this dataset, there are 20 individuals from the following populations: GBR (Brits/Scots), JPT (Japanese), YRI (Yoruban).

Create some symlinks that lead to the following files:

```
ln -s ~/populationgenomics/data/relate_data/20140520.chr2.strict_mask.fasta
ln -s ~/populationgenomics/data/relate_data/genetic_map_chr2_combined_b37.txt
ln -s ~/populationgenomics/data/relate_data/human_ancestor_2.fa
ln -s ~/populationgenomics/data/relate_data/60_inds.txt
ln -s~/populationgenomics/data/relate_data/chr2_130_145_phased.vcf.gz
```

The first file is a mask containing areas that either have abnormal read depth or has been identified to contain repetitive elements.
The second file is a recombination map.
The third file is the ancestral state of every site, based on an alignment with Gorilla, Chimp and Human genomes.
The fourth file is a metadata file detailing the population and region for each sample.
The last file is the phased genotype vcf.

The documentation for Relate can be found [here](https://myersgroup.github.io/relate/).

> **NB:** The names of input files for Relate are always supplied without file extensions.

Relate does not accept the standard vcf file format, but instead uses a haps/sample format. You can read up on in the Relate documentation. The authors have been so kind as to supply a script to transform it. First, the vcf is converted to another file format (haplotype file format). If you want to know how it is structured, you can read about it [here](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/formats#haps).

```
~/populationgenomics/software/relate/bin/RelateFileFormats --mode ConvertFromVcf --haps chr2.haps --sample chr2.sample -i chr2_130_145_phased
```

Then, repetitive (unreliably sequenced) regions must be masked to exclude them form our analysis. We also need to assign each variant as either ancestral or derived using the chimpanzee genome. We do both with this command:

```
~/populationgenomics/software/relate/scripts/PrepareInputFiles/PrepareInputFiles.sh --haps chr2.haps --sample chr2.sample --ancestor human_ancestor_2.fa --mask 20140520.chr2.strict_mask.fasta -o prep.chr2
```

Inspect the generated files. 

**Q1: How many SNPs were removed due to non-matching nucleotides?**

**Q2: How many were removed due to the mask?**

## Build trees along the genome

Now, the input is fully prepared, and Relate can be run. This should take less than a minute.

```
~/populationgenomics/software/relate/bin/Relate --mode All -m 1.25e-8 -N 30000 --haps prep.chr2.haps.gz --sample prep.chr2.sample.gz --map genetic_map_chr2_combined_b37.txt -o chr2_relate
```

**Q3: How many SNPs are left per haplotype?**

## Estimate historical population size and reestimate branch lengths of trees

The lengthiest process is this step, in which population size is estimated, and the population size is re-estimates branch lengths. This takes around 20 minutes. While you are waiting, look at the ARG notebook at the bottom of this page.

```
~/populationgenomics/software/relate/scripts/EstimatePopulationSize/EstimatePopulationSize.sh -i chr2_relate -m 1.25e-8 --poplabels 60_inds.txt -o popsize --threshold 0
```

> While this is running jump to the bottom part of the exercise about ancestral recombination graphs. One you are done with that part of the exercise, return here to finish the Relate exercise.

----

Relate outputs estimated mutation rate and coalescence times along the region

**Q4: Look at the files and see what you learn**

We will revisit this exercise in later sessions. So for now, just have a look at some of the estimated trees to get an impression of what they look like. You can do this using the command below. You specify the position you want to see using the `--bp_of_interest` option. The command below produces a `tree.pdf` file showing the tree for position 14000000:

```
~/populationgenomics/software/relate/scripts/TreeView/TreeView.sh --haps chr2.haps --sample chr2.sample --anc popsize.anc --mut popsize.mut --poplabels 60_inds.txt --years_per_gen 28 -o tree --bp_of_interest 14000000
```
