# Inferring historical populations sizes using PSMC

The Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC) model uses information in the complete diploid sequence of a single individual to infer the history of population size changes. The method was published in 2011 ([Li and Durbin 2011](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10231)) in the paper that you discussed in class. It has become a very popular tool in the world of genomics. In this exercise, we first walk through the steps to generate the necessary input data for PSMC. Then we run PSMC on chromosome 2 of an individual from the Simons Diversity Panel and plot the results.

For additional detail on how to run PSMC see the [GitHub page](https://github.com/lh3/psmc) for PSMC source code.

The method you used for base calling in an earlier exercise is state of the art. Unfortunately, to produce the input data for PSMC we cannot just use the base calls or VCF files that we already produced. The first reason is that PSMC required more data than the 10Mb of chromosome 2 that you called bases on. The second reason is that the way you did your base calls do not let us easily produce input data for PSMC, which is a consensus sequence that represents the diploid genome. 

The files we are goint to use are the following:
- BAM file: ~/populationgenomics/data/bam/S_Hungarian-2.chr2.bam
- BAI file: ~/populationgenomics/data/bam/S_Hungarian-2.chr2.bam.bai
- Fasta file: ~/populationgenomics/data/fasta/chr2.fa

Start by creating soft links to these files in your own folder. The example individual used below is a Hungarian individual with id ERR1025630. You can replace that to run the same analysis on another individual.

## Calling consensus sequence

Start by asking for a computing machine by running this command:

srun --mem-per-cpu=5g --time=3:00:00 --account=populationgenomics --pty bash

Starting from mapped reads, the first step is to produce a consensus sequence in FASTQ format, which stores both the sequence and its corresponding quality scores, that will be used for QC filtering. The consensus sequence has A, T, C or G at homozygous sites, and other letters [IUPAC codes](https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html) to represent heterozygotes. To make the consensus calls, we use the samtools/bcftools suite. We first use `samtools mpileup` to get the pileup of reads for each position. We then generate a consensus sequence with `bcftools`, which we convert to FASTQ (with some additional filtering) by `vcfutils.pl`. We take advantage of Unix pipes and the ability of `samtools` to work with streaming input and output to run the whole pipeline (`samtools` -> `bcftools` -> `vcfutils.pl`) as one command. We run our consensus calling pipeline, consisting of a linked set of `samtools`, `bcftools`, and `vcfutils.pl` commands:

```bash
    samtools mpileup -Q 30 -q 30 -u -v -f chr2.fa -r 2 S_Hungarian-2.chr2.bam| ~/populationgenomics/software/bcftools call -c | vcfutils.pl vcf2fq -d 5 -D 100 -Q 30 > S_Hungarian-2.chr2.fq
```

The command takes as input an aligned bam file and a reference genome, generates a summary of the coverage of mapped reads on a reference sequence at a single base pair resolution using `samtools mpileup`, then calls the consensus sequence with `bcftools`, and then filters and converts the consensus to FASTQ format. Some parameter explanations:

1. `samtools`:
    - `-Q` and `-q` in mpileup determine the cutoffs for baseQ and mapQ, respectively
    - `-v` tells mpileup to produce vcf output, and `-u` says that should be uncompressed
    - `-f` is the reference fasta used 
    - `-r` is the region to call the mpileup for (in this case, a particular chromosome)
2. `bcftools`:
    - call `-c` calls a consensus sequence from the mpileup using the original calling method
3. `vcfutils.pl`:
    - `-d 5` and `-D 100` determine the minimum and maximum coverage to allow for `vcf2fq`, anything outside that range is filtered
    - `-Q 30` sets the root mean squared mapping quality minimum to 30

This takes a long to run (about 5-6 hours) so if you get tired of waiting you can get it here:

~/populationgenomics/data/consensus_fastq/S_Hungarian-2.chr2.fq

There you can also find FASTQ files for all the other individuals we have been working with.

## Creating a PSMC input file
PSMC takes the consensus FASTQ file, and infers the history of population sizes, but first we need to convert this FASTQ file to the input format for PSMC:

```bash
    ~/populationgenomics/software/fq2psmcfa -q20 S_Hungarian-2.chr2.fq > S_Hungarian-2.chr2.psmcfa
```

This transforms the consensus sequence into a fasta-like format where the i-th character in the output sequence indicates whether there is at least one heterozygote in the bin [100i, 100i+100). Have a look at the file using `less`.

## Running PSMC

Now we are finally ready to run PSMC. You do that like this:

```bash
    ~/populationgenomics/software/psmc -N50 -t15 -r5 -p "4+25*2+4+6" -o S_Hungarian-2.chr2.psmc S_Hungarian-2.chr2.psmcfa
```

The command line in the example above has been shown to be suitable for modern humans, inappropiate settings might lead to under/over-fitting. The `-p` and `-t` options are used to specify the length and number of time intervals. The `-r` option is used to specify the initial theta/rho ratio. The `-N` option sets the maximum number of EM iterations in the fitting of model parameters.

This PSMC analysis takes about 25 minutes to complete. 

## Plot your results

When the PSMC completes you can make the PSMC plot. You have to specify the per-generation mutation rate using `-u` and the generation time in years using `-g`. To make the plotting script work must first run the following command so the plotting routine knows where to find a file it needs:

```bash
    export GNUPLOT_PS_DIR=~/miniconda3/envs/popgen/share/gnuplot/5.0/PostScript
    export PATH=$PATH:~/populationgenomics/software
```

We will also need to install an additional package to our conda environment:

```bash
    conda install -c conda-forge ghostscript
```

Then you can generate the plot like this:

```bash
    psmc_plot.pl -R -u 1.2e-08 -g 25 S_Hungarian-2.chr2 S_Hungarian-2.chr2.psmc
```

The `-u` option specifies the per year mutation rate and the `-g` the generation time. The `-R` option preserves the intermediate files the script produces. The latter is handy if you want to make plots yourself combining several PSMC analyses.

## Compare individuals from different regions of the world

We want to compare individuals from different regions. Run the same commands for samples of different regions. 

The, plot all results together in a R jupyter notebook. Try out the code below:

```R
library(ggplot2)

psmc_data1 <- read.table("S_Hungarian-2.chr2.0.txt", header=F, col.names = c('Years', 'Effective_pop_size', 'X', 'Y', 'C'))
psmc_data2 <- read.table("S_Ju_hoan_North-3.chr2.0.txt", header=F, col.names = c('Years', 'Effective_pop_size', 'X', 'Y', 'C'))

# If data 1 is African and data2 is European you can type: 

psmc_data1$region = 'European'
psmc_data2$region = 'African'

d = data.frame(
                Region = c(psmc_data1$type, psmc_data2$region), 
                Years = c(psmc_data1$Years, psmc_data2$Years), 
                Effective_pop_size = c(psmc_data1$Effective_pop_size,psmc_data2$Effective_pop_size)
                )

ggplot(d, aes(x=Years, y=Effective_pop_size, color="NCL-08")) + 
  geom_line(aes(color=Region), size=1.5) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x= expression(paste("Years (g=25, ", mu, "=2,5*", 10^-8,")")), y="Effective population size", title='Results of PSMC') +
  scale_x_log10(breaks=c(1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000), minor_breaks=c(500, 5000, 50000, 500000)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,3))

```
